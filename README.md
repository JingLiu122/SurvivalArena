# SurvivalArena
A simple survival game that is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and programmed in Blueprint. A simple game project that is based on the winning condition to complete each spawned wave, and there are 5 waves in total (easy to debug); each wave spawned a few enemies to chase and attack the player if they are in their detection radius; to clear each wave: the player had to kill all the bots on the level. Also included a player controller character: a Knight or Mage (Mage is a child of Knight-to share common features and consistency); but the player must have to manually swap it in the game mode, did not implement this feature like the real video game that allow the player to choose their favorite class/job in it. A controller character attacked with a unique assigned attack animation with the used of Animation Blueprint; for example, a Knight character plays the melee attack animation (it has two swings), and a Mage character plays the casting spell animation when she attacked.

Implemented a basic AI/bot that can be wandered by the used of Navigation Mesh Bounds Volume, chased and attacked the player if they are in their attacked range. However, all the bots in the game are reusing the character classes because of consistent use. Designed and detailed the only one level (not enough time) in this project with the scene of fantasy ruined castle, and with the used of Landscape mode. Later on, I expanded the game to have some interfaces: main menu, winning screen, death screen, and scoring HUD; health pick-up systems; and audios.
